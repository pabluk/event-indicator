Event Indicator
===============

It's just a proof of concept using the [AppIndicator API](http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/c/AppIndicator3-0.1.html) on Ubuntu 12.04 to register events.


Usage
-----

You don't need to install anything, it's only run as a regular python script

```bash
$ python event-indicator.py
```
