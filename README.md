Event Indicator
===============

It's just a proof of concept using the [AppIndicator API](http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/c/AppIndicator3-0.1.html) to register events.

Tested with Python 2.7 and 3.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10.


Usage
-----

You don't need to install anything, it's only run as a regular python script

```bash
$ python event-indicator.py
```
